The relationship between the MediaService and the User Service should be designed to facilitate the management and serving of multimedia content while ensuring secure and efficient data exchange. Here are recommendations on how this relationship can be established extensively:

1. MediaService Responsibilities:

The MediaService should primarily focus on managing multimedia content, including photos and videos attached to user posts. It should handle the storage, retrieval, and serving of media files.
2. User Service Responsibilities:

The User Service should continue to manage user profiles, authentication, and user-related data. This includes user IDs, avatars, and user connections (e.g., followers and friends).
3. User-Media Relationship:

Media content uploaded by users should be associated with the respective users. This association can be established by storing metadata about the media files, such as the user's ID, in the MediaService's database.
4. Secure Authentication:

Both the User Service and MediaService should have robust and secure authentication mechanisms. The User Service is responsible for user authentication, while the MediaService should validate user access to media content.
5. API Endpoints:

The MediaService should expose API endpoints for uploading, retrieving, and serving media content. These endpoints may include:
Uploading media files.
Retrieving media files for user profiles and posts.
Serving media content to users based on their requests.
6. User Profile and Posts:

When a user uploads media content (e.g., a profile picture or a post with images or videos), the User Service can notify the MediaService about the uploaded files. The MediaService should then store and associate the media with the user's ID.
7. Access Control:

The MediaService should validate access to media files based on user authentication and authorization. Only authenticated users should have access to their own media content.
8. Performance and Caching:

Implement caching mechanisms in the MediaService to enhance performance. Cached media content can be served quickly without repeatedly accessing storage, improving the user experience.
9. Real-time Updates:

Implement real-time updates so that when users change their profile pictures or upload new media content, these changes are immediately reflected across the platform, including the User Service.
10. Monitoring and Scalability:

Implement monitoring and logging to track media content-related activities and performance.
Ensure that the MediaService is horizontally scalable to handle increasing media storage and serving demands.
11. Third-Party Integrations:

If your application relies on third-party services for media storage (e.g., Amazon S3 or Digital Ocean Spaces), establish a clear integration strategy to ensure seamless data transfer and access.
By establishing this relationship, you can ensure that multimedia content is efficiently managed and served while maintaining data consistency and access controls. The User Service and MediaService work together to provide a seamless user experience for uploading, retrieving, and displaying media content throughout the HapiChat application.
